    <h1>Diary</h1>
    <p>
      2019-05-09 : Stated to make my own website, 'sYz', by using GitHub Pages.<br>
      Wanted to name my ID 'syz' to use a neat domain, but somebody has already taken it.<br>
      Choosed to name my githhub ID 'syz2'.<br>
      'z' means 2, b'cause it looks like number 2. '2' means 'v' for victory, and also V sign.<br>
      'syz' sounds like 'xyz', may sound like a pun.<br>
      Think I need to develop my english skills & coding skills desperately.<br>
