      I've got my new nickname! Hooray!<br>
      Hope this would be the last one... 😹<br>
      Now I need to change all my personal & business accounts.<br>
      Maybe I can also change my password. 🤫<br>
      I wasn't wrong — I just had a different plan.<br>
      Well done, Katie!<br>

      Learned how to make my own website by using GitHub Pages. (Thanks, 생코!)<br>

      Wanted to name my GitHub ID 'syz' to use a neat domain, but somebody had already taken it.<br>
      Plan B, 'syz2'.<br>
      'z' means 2, b'cause it looks like number 2. '2' means 'v' for victory, and also V sign.<br>
      'syz' sounds like 'xyz', may sound like a pun.<br>
      Think I need to develop my english skills & coding skills desperately.<br>
